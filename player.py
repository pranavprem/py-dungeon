# the hero is represented by object 'hero'
# hero can perform several actions such as movement, attacking etc.
# actions can be performed by saying
#    hero.move('left')
# other possible actions are:
#    hero.rest()              -> restores 10% of the health
#    hero.feel(direction)     -> returns what is there in 'direction'
#    hero.move(direction)     -> move in 'direction'
#        direction can be 'left', 'right', 'up', 'down'
#    hero.optmove()           -> returns the direction the hero should move to 
#                                reach the rope
# note that loops are not allowed
