Level 1

After the hugely successful Techdisc 2.0, Hero (a.k.a. M Bhai or Bhai or Don of Dons), has been imprisoned and brutally tortured by the dungeon monsters Varkey and Maru. 
One day, in a sudden turn of events, Hero finds himself an empty passageway that his guts tell him is his only means of escape...

Level 2

That almost seemed too easy.. 


OH NO! It was a set up. Bhai is now faced with the VARKEY MONSTER! Is this the end?


Level 3

Too close. Thank goodness Hero Bhai had your help.

GOOD LORD! The Varkey monster has brought along her sinister friend, Maru monster! Can Hero Bhai fend against them BOTH?

Level 4

After ages of captivity, Hero Bhai thanks you for your help in bringing him this far.

But now, because the developers of this game want to show off, Hero Bhai must face the horrors of TWO DIMENTIONS!


Level 5

What's this? The varkies have taken their time to regenerate and become stronger! Can Hero Bhai brave through not one but TWO BADASS VARKIES?!
